          Across all strategies we kept text-encoder weights, guidance scale, and denoising schedule fixed. Vanilla Stable Diffusion is fastest but struggles with layout control. Recursive Diffusion adds light GPTâ†”vision loops for precise counts and positions but incurs extra runtime and occasional mask instability. SLD uses a single GPT-derived layout with an attention steering loss, balancing overhead and reliability.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Improved Attribute Binding</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The recursive feedback loop helps resolve ambiguities in attribute assignment, ensuring that descriptors in the prompt are correctly associated with their intended objects. This addresses a common failure mode in existing systems where attributes may be incorrectly swapped between different elements in the scene.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Enhanced Spatial Reasoning</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          By evaluating spatial relationships across iterations, our model demonstrates superior ability to represent positional descriptions accurately. This is particularly evident in prompts that specify complex arrangements of multiple objects.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conceptual Fidelity</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Abstract concepts and themes that might be overlooked in a single-pass approach are progressively reinforced through the recursive mechanism, resulting in images that better capture the intended conceptual elements of the prompt.
